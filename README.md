## ConsolePipe

----
This plugin allows to simply "pipe" the console outputs to a specific player, e.g. for debugging purposes, so that you don't always need to switch between multiple windows or turn your head by 180Â° just to view that other unpleasantly placed monitor.
It is also pretty insecure, because you might accidentally view stuff that should stay in the console. :)
